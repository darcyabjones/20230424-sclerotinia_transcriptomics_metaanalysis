I ran the sclerotinia genome on the fungismash v7.0.0 webserver https://fungismash.secondarymetabolites.org/.
I provided the genome and gene predictions, and specified to run all extra analysis, but not the boundary refinement based on TFBS prediction.

I downloaded the complete results to output/fungismash.zip
